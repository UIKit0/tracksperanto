Tracksperanto has a huge test corpus of test files, which is stored in the project's Github repo.

This is why the repo is so big.

However, most users of Tracksperanto are actually _users_, they won't need 
all the testing data. And without this data, tracksperanto is less than 
100 kilobytes in size.

However, if you intend to actually write code that uses Tracksperanto or to fix
a bug, you will most definitely need all the test data. In that case, just do a git checkout.
