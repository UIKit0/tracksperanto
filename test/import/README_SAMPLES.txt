Tracksperanto has a huge test corpus of test files, which is stored in the project's Github repo.
Checkout the repo to run tests against these samples.

Since most users of Tracksperanto are actually USERS, they do not need to download loads and loads
of test files as opposed to 80 kilobytes of the program itself.

If you want to develop against Tracksperanto we advise you DO use
the test corpus though, so please pretty please just pull it off Github.
