Export tests are conformance tests. That means that:

1) An export is made using Tracksperanto
2) This export gets checked by importing it into the main app 
that accepts such files
3) The export is compared with Tracksperanto output in the test

This means that unless you own an app that accepts this particular format
you cannot overwrite the export with your own since you got no way to verify
that the export works
