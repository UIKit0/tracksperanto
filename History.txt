* Nicer progress reports
* Modified the Accumulator to support nested iterations and random access

=== 2.2.4 / 2011-04-04

* Properly deal with negative frames happening in Shake scripts sometimes. We will now recognize a script starting at negative
frames and "bump" it's frames in curves so that everything neatly starts at frame 0. Granted this does not give us the same frame range
but most apps wil go bonkers anyway if we send them negative frame numbers.

=== 2.2.3 / 2011-04-03

* Prevent zero-length trackers (trackers having no position information) from being accumulated during import.
This had adverse effects on export modules that could not export trackers containing no information. As a sidenote we
will write down in the doco that an export module should not expect empty trackers with no keyframes to be sent

=== 2.2.2 / 2011-04-03

* The last change to PFMatchit exporter had adverse effects on pftrack files, now fixed.
* Pipeline now has it's own exceptions, all inheriting from RuntimeError

=== 2.2.1 / 2011-04-01

* April fool!
* PFMAtchit requires LF in it's files instead of CRLF, but our FPTrack exporter used CRLF. Now fixed.
* Changed PFMatchit exporter to export .txt files instead of .2dt

=== 2.2.0 / 2011-03-01

* Improve documentation substantially
* Changed the Import::Base interface yo use enumeration instead of @receiver.
Upside: This allows us to convert importers to an array of trackers and other niceties.
Downside: stream_parse will be deprecated. It is however still available for backwards compatibility
  
=== 2.1.1 / 2011-02-14

* Fix handling of Shake scripts containing stabilizer nodes with no animation
* Remove underscores from tracker names exported to Syntheyes to prevent spaces from being generated

=== 2.1.0 / 2011-02-08
* Adds PFMatchit import support. Also all PFTrack imported cameras will have a camera name injected into the tracker
* Adds a PFMatchit exporter (PFMatchit only wants cameras with numbers in the name)

=== 2.0.2 / 2011-02-02
* Compatible with Ruby 1.9.2
* Scaler middleware now supports negative scaling factors

=== 2.0.0 / 2011-01-27
* Bugfix for PFTrack exports to contain cross-platform linebreaks (rn instead of n)

=== 1.9.9 / 2010-08-11

* Buffer the parsed trackers on disk or in a stream (all backwards-compatible). Substantially reduces conversion times and memory
  usage on huge files.

=== 1.9.8 / 2010-08-11

* Very minor changes and improvements
* The app will now tell you when you try to feed it an empty file
* Change Synetheyes exports to start with a standard frame and not a keyframe to make 1-frame trackers work
* Adds a flip middleware to mirror a tracked comp

=== 1.9.6 / 2010-06-17

* Support Tracker nodes in Shake scripts that come from an old (ages old!) Shake version
* Only parse channels that are actually relevant in the Flame importer

=== 1.9.5 / 2010-05-17

* Increase the size of the in-mem string export buffer

=== 1.9.4 / 2010-04-16

* Fix the boujou exporter to not crash boujou 5

=== 1.9.3 / 2010-04-15

* Add direct export to boujou feature tracks
* Automatically check for new versions and alert the user that he needs an update
* Add tests for the commandline binary itself

=== 1.9.2 / 2010-04-02

* Fix a crasher when the progress bar was being set higher than 100 percent

=== 1.9.1 / 2010-03-21

* Fix a Pipeline bug introduced with the last version

=== 1.9.0 / 2010-03-21

* Use proper progress bars
* Allow proper chaining of middlewares in the commandline app - you can now apply many middlewares of the same nature in chain, and they will be ordered correctly
* Small rewrites to Pipeline::Base (changes API slightly - please consult the docs)

=== 1.8.4 / 2010-03-10

* Fix PFTrack imports neglecting the feature name if it only contained digits

=== 1.8.3 / 2010-03-04

* Fix faulty remaining trackers report being sent from the pipeline

=== 1.8.2 / 2010-03-04

* Fix the bug in the Flame exporter that was convincing Flame that there is only one tracker in the setup

* Add Flame stabilizer export support

=== 1.7.5 / 2010-02-17

* Use a special IO so that we can display progress when parsing/reading a file (based on the IO offset)

=== 1.7.4 / 2010-02-02

* Introduce an intentional gap in the reference exports to test trackers with gaps
* Export Syntheyes paths as normal frames, not as keyframes. This produces better solves by not overconstraining the solver
	(Without this TransitionFrms, a crucial parameter in SY, seizes to work)
* Add a LengthCutoff middleware that allows you to remove trackers that have less than X keyframes in them from the export

=== 1.7.3 / 2010-02-02

* Fixed the --only option in the commandline binary

=== 1.7.2 / 2010-01-31

* Add a Lerp middleware that linearly interpolates missing keyframes (USE CAREFULLY!)
* Prevent the Shake lexer from walking into the woods on files that are certainly wrong
* Export proper project length with Nuke scripts
* Ensure preamble for Nuke exports does not get overriden in width/height

=== 1.7.1 / 2010-01-24

* Fix Ruby 1.9 compatibility

=== 1.7.0 / 2010-01-24

=== 1.6.9 / 2010-01-20

* Make the commandline progress reports shorter

=== 1.6.8 / 2010-01-13

* Fix frame gap handling for repeating gaps in the Nuke importer

=== 1.6.7 / 2010-01-13

* Fix frame gap sizes in the Nuke exporter (thanks Michael Lester)

=== 1.6.6 / 2009-12-07

* Handle Hermite cuves in Shake scripts

=== 1.6.5 / 2009-11-27

=== 1.6.3 / 2009-11-25

* Fixes the Shake importer so that it doesn't apply correlation curves if they are not present or constantized to 1

=== 1.6.2 / 2009-11-15

* Fixes the Reformat middleware to not suppress the end_export call. Crucial for exporters that
  use end_export to finalize output
  
=== 1.6.0 / 2009-11-15

* MatchMover has top-left coordinates - fixed for both import and export
* Prevent Tracker from being Array#flatten'ed

=== 1.5.7 / 2009-11-08
