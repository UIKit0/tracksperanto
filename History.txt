=== 1.8.3 / 2010-03-04

* Fix faulty remaining trackers report being sent from the pipeline

=== 1.8.2 / 2010-03-04

* Fix the bug in the Flame exporter that was convincing Flame that there is only one tracker in the setup
* Buffer temporary outputs to String buffers until they reach a certain size. Helps with tempfile pollution and IO speed

=== 1.8.1 / 2010-02-18

* Add Flame stabilizer export support

=== 1.7.5 / 2010-02-17

* Use a special IO so that we can display progress when parsing/reading a file (based on the IO offset)

=== 1.7.4 / 2010-02-02

* Introduce an intentional gap in the reference exports to test trackers with gaps
* Export Syntheyes paths as normal frames, not as keyframes. This produces better solves by not overconstraining the solver
	(Without this TransitionFrms, a crucial parameter in SY, seizes to work)
* Add a LengthCutoff middleware that allows you to remove trackers that have less than X keyframes in them from the export

=== 1.7.3 / 2010-02-02

* Fixed the --only option in the commandline binary

=== 1.7.2 / 2010-01-31

* Add a Lerp middleware that linearly interpolates missing keyframes (USE CAREFULLY!)
* Prevent the Shake lexer from walking into the woods on files that are certainly wrong
* Export proper project length with Nuke scripts
* Ensure preamble for Nuke exports does not get overriden in width/height

=== 1.7.1 / 2010-01-24

* Fix Ruby 1.9 compatibility

=== 1.7.0 / 2010-01-24

* Fix edge cases of specific comp sizes outputting incorrect exports for Equalizer 3 and MatchMover

=== 1.6.9 / 2010-01-20

* Make the commandline progress reports shorter

=== 1.6.8 / 2010-01-13

* Fix frame gap handling for repeating gaps in the Nuke importer

=== 1.6.7 / 2010-01-13

* Fix frame gap sizes in the Nuke exporter (thanks Michael Lester)

=== 1.6.6 / 2009-12-07

* Handle Hermite cuves in Shake scripts

=== 1.6.5 / 2009-11-27

* Adds the --only option for the tracksperanto binary to only export a specific format
* Automatically unlink tempfiles in the Equalizer4 exporter

=== 1.6.4 / 2009-11-25

* Adds Boujou 2d feature import support (to export for Boujou use the Shake text format)

=== 1.6.3 / 2009-11-25

* Fixes the Shake importer so that it doesn't apply correlation curves if they are not present or constantized to 1

=== 1.6.2 / 2009-11-15

* Fixes the Reformat middleware to not suppress the end_export call. Crucial for exporters that
  use end_export to finalize output
  
=== 1.6.0 / 2009-11-15

* MatchMover has top-left coordinates - fixed for both import and export
* Prevent Tracker from being Array#flatten'ed

=== 1.5.7 / 2009-11-08

* Add a Prefix middleware that prefixes tracker names

=== 1.5.6 / 2009-11-08

* Rerelase of 1.5.5 without the huge binary blob in the middle
* Interpret Shake NSplines as Linear instead of discarding them

=== 1.5.4 / 2009-10-25

* Fix a bug in the Shake importer for tracks that have no animation

=== 1.5.3 / 2009-10-17

* Fix a bug in the Nuke importer for tracks that have no animation

=== 1.5.2 / 2009-10-09

* Fix Windows-specific issue (Tempfile-related) in the Equalizer4 exporter
* Add Export::Base#just_export and Middleware::Base#just_export

=== 1.5.0 / 2009-10-09

* Implement support for older 3DE exports (in and out)

=== 1.4.0 / 2009-10-02

* Implement MayaLive import and export

=== 1.3.1 / 2009-09-23

* Implement 3DE import and export

=== 1.2.7 / 2009-09-22

* Improved progress reporting

=== 1.2.6 / 2009-09-21

* Add const_name to the classes being introspected most often

=== 1.2.5 / 2009-09-21

* Reset residual on Syntheyes imports to 0

=== 1.2.4 / 2009-09-21

* Write to files in binary mode

=== 1.2.3 / 2009-09-21

* Support both PFTrack 4 and 5 

=== 1.2.1 / 2009-09-21

* Fixed the binary that was not able to properly pass the importer class to the pipeline

=== 1.2.0 / 2009-09-20

* Add experimental MatchMoverPro import and export support
* Rewrite the Shake parser, support MatchMove and Stabilize nodes and many tracks per node
* Officially add and test the Reformat middleware
* Remove the Close middleware and close IOs automatically at pipeline end
* Much improved documentation

* Much improved test coverage
* Support Nuke import and export

=== 1.0.0 / 2009-04-19

* Welcome
